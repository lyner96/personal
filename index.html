I am a young computer science researcher and still searching for my research interest. <br>

I have involved in <a href="https://lyner.me/page/research/" target="_blank">research</a> related to data mining, interpretability on neural networks. <br>

Aside from research, I plan to share the knowledge I got in this website which I have yet started. <br>
